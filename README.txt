This is a little python program that lets you use youtube-dl with higher resolutions (and maybe it's easier to use?)

Features:
1. Commandline options
2. Higher resolutions than 720p60 (on YoutubeDL you can go up to 720p60 for sound and video combined, but not higher)
3. Questions if you don't like commandline options

Requirements:
1. youtube-dl in the path or in the same directory (of course)
2. ffmpeg
